When checking for invalid URLs using `urlchecker::url_check()`, I get four errors similar to this:
```
âœ– Error: vignettes/Framingham_heart_study.Rmd:29:241 403: Forbidden
```
They seem to be occurring for all the doi links. I tried to find a workaround, but was unable to find a good solution, so I hope this is not a big problem.
